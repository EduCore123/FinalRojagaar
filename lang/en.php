The concept of Rojagaar is a step towards providing employment to the rural laborers with daily wages as their means of livelihood. Its small attempt towards providing day-to-day work to uneducated or less educated, unskilled laborers in rural areas. Today, agriculture as well as agro-business needs a lot of laborers but it needs proper co-ordination between Farm Owners and Farm Laborers!
In today's digital world, it is a means of connecting the needy laborers in rural areas to the farmers or businessmen who have availability of work using the new Computer/Mobile technology.
Nowadays, Farmers are searching Farm Labors in known circle only. With this new technology, any Laborer/Farmer from nearby villages with known or unknown circle can be contacted and called /asked for work and this will make the work easier for both the farm laborers and the farmers. Due to lack of education or lack of English skills in rural areas, this platform is being made available in regional languages also. ..... Thank You …!!! ",
